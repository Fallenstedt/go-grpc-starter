# I usually keep a `VERSION` file in the root so that anyone

# up inside the Docker image too.

# As a call to `make` without any arguments leads to the execution
# of the first target found I really prefer to make sure that this
# first one is a non-destructive one that does the most simple 
# desired installation. 
#
# It's very common to people set it as `all` but it could be anything 
# like `a`.
all: install


# Install just performs a normal `go install` which builds the source
# files from the package at `./` (I like to keep a `main.go` in the root
# that imports other subpackages). 
#
# As I always commit `vendor` to `git`, a `go install` will typically 
# always work - except if there's an OS limitation in the build flags 
# (e.g, a linux-only project).

# Keeping `./main.go` with just a `cli` and `./lib/*.go` with actual 
# logic, `tests` usually reside under `./lib` (or some other subdirectories).
#
# By using the `./...` notation, all the non-vendor packages are going
# to be tested if they have test files.

	go test ./greet/... -v



# This target is only useful if you plan to also create a Docker image at
# the end. 
#
# I really like publishing a Docker image together with the GitHub release
# because Docker makes it very simple to someone run your binary without
# having to worry about the retrieval of the binary and execution of it
# - docker already provides the necessary boundaries.

# Goreleaser is a tool that allows anyone to integrate a binary releasing
# process to their pipelines. 
#
# Here in this target With just a simple `make release` you can have a 
# `tag` created in GitHub with multiple builds if you wish. 
#
# See more at `gorelease` github repo.
